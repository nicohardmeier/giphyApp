Giphy App <br />
Made by Nicol√°s Hardmeier

This project was created with react and create-react-app. It uses the flux(redux) pattern as a state management. The load of gifs and settings of the filter are all in the redux state.

I also used node-sass for styling and integrated the Material UI library for the input, buttons, and switchs.

The search options are by type ("gifs" or "stickers"), the results can be also sorted by date. For now, just ascending order but this can also be improved adding a sorting order switch.

The grid with the gif list is made with "react-masonry-css" and uses "react-infinite-scroller" to manage the scroll.

When a user clicks on a gif, a modal window is displayed with the selected gif and details as title, user, and rating if are defined. It also has a work in progress functionality of a share on WhatsApp button(only available in phones) as a feature I would personally add to this app as a future improvement.
